  \hline
  \textbf{Version} & \textbf{Date} & \textbf{Notable Changes} \\
  \hline
  0.1.0 & 2020-09-19 & Initial version as proposed jointly by WizKit and FROMAGER teams on DARPA SIEVE. \\
  \hline
  0.1.1
  & 2020-12-16 & A number of bugfixes on the prior version.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Fix typographical errors and omissions.
    \item Add checks for matching header, \texttt{num\_wires}, and etc., across multiple resources.
    \item Eliminate unused type-checking and arity-checking attributes from the attribute grammar, because IR0 has only one meaningful type.
    \item Add \texttt{num\_wires} to the instance and witness in the text and binary grammars (sections \ref{text} and \ref{binary}).
  \end{itemize} \\
  \hline
  0.2.0 & 2021-03-19 & Remove the \texttt{num\_wires} and associated input size data and add a \texttt{@delete} directive. \\
  \hline
  1.0.0 & 2021-07-20 & Add ``uniformity'' features: function gates, public-index for loops, and private-condition switch-case statements. \\
  \hline
  1.0.1 & 2022-04-29 & Fix the following issues:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Fix switch-statement semantics which required a nested switch-statement where the outer case is inactive and the inner switch-statement has no active branch to cause an unexpected witness-statement invalidity.
      \item Constrain for-loop bounds and wire-ranges such that the first must be less than or equal to the last iteration or wire.
      \item Add a warning that the switch-statement conversion algorithm (\ref{multiplexing}) may produce a poorly-formed relation with certain forms of switch-statement and for-loop nesting. Add a suggestion to unroll for-loops in those conditions.
      \item Assorted typo fixes and performance improvements.

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

This document specifies the current version of the SIEVE Intermediate Representation (IR).
Changes to this specification are to be discussed and modified only through the decision process outlined in the \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1imP-9fXy8fQwr1e6ZEuhHnVDGkh1YdUOjEd1ifas6IM/edit?ts=5f614241&pli=1}{SIEVE IR Agreement document}.
This document will be updated to reflect such changes. \\

The IR is an interaction between the front-end and the back-end portions of a Zero Knowledge (ZK) proof pipeline.
The frontend transforms high level statements in a target domain into the IR.
It is the producer of the three resources which are the subject of this document.
The backend is the consumer of them: it is an interaction between a Prover and a Verifier, where the Prover wishes to prove a statement to the Verifier, without revealing a secret component of the proof. \\

At a high level, this interaction involves four (4) resources, one of which is still \href{https://github.mit.edu/sieve-all/collaboration/issues/15}{under development}.
Conceptually, each resource could be stored as a file, or transported as a stream.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Relation - a set of directives forming a mathematical relationship between inputs. We use the language of circuitry to describe this relationship.
  \item Instance - common inputs to the circuit, provided by the frontend to the backend, and within the backend are available to Prover and Verifier.
  \item Short Witness - secret inputs to the circuit, provided by the frontend to the backend, which are later used in proof construction as secrets of the Prover.
  We refer to this as a ``short witness'' to distinguish from the Rank One Constraint System's (R1CS) witness in which each variable must have an assignment.
In the SIEVE IR, only certain wires are assigned from the short witness, the others are computed by the circuit.
  \item ``JR'' Hints (``I+1 Representation'') - hints from the backend to the frontend describing optimal circuit generation parameters. This resource is currently \href{https://github.mit.edu/sieve-all/collaboration/issues/15}{under development}.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth,center]{ir-dataflow.png} \\

In its simplest form, the relation is a list of gate directives, each with an output wire and two input wires.
The gates and their connections through wires form a circuit.
This simple form is useful for streaming, where the proof system may consume a gate, process it, and immediately discard everything except the output wire.
These simple circuits can process wire values in two fields, either $GF(p)$ (``arithmetic'') or $GF(2)$ (``boolean'').
Beyond this simple form, the IR adds features for expressing uniformity in the circuit.
These features may be toggled on or off for a given relation, either enabling greater expressiveness, or guaranteeing the simple stream processing.
The first of these features is ``function-gates'' which encapsulate functionalities to be reused.
``For-loops'' repeat a sub-circuit for a fixed number of repetitions.
Lastly ``switch-case statements'' enable private conditions to be expressed directly in the IR.
These constructs both compact a relation and allow proof systems to quickly recognize structures and in some cases amortize computational effort.\\

\subsection{Concrete IR Formats}
This specification defines two forms, to resolve conflicting usage patterns between human and computer use cases.
To avoid ambiguity during translation from binary to text or vice-versa, special care must be taken to ensure that the text and binary formats remain isomorphic.
Specifically, every element defined by one format has an equivalent in the other format.\\

\begin{itemize}
  \item Text format - For human use during education, demonstration, and development.
  \item Binary format - For automated use in a performance critical environment.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{IR Validity and Semantics}\label{ir_validity}
In addition to isomorphic structure, both formats should have the same semantics.
This specification considers a few levels of validity, ranging from syntax and recognition through the acceptance of a proof given in the IR.
Each of the following validities is considered successive over the prior.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Syntactic Validity:} If a resource matches the syntactic constraints of either the Text (section \ref{text}) or Binary (section \ref{binary}) formats, then it is syntactically valid.\\
    \item \textbf{Resource Validity:} Each resource may be \textit{well-formed} if it, in isolation, satisfies constraints given in section \ref{text}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Relation Well-formedness:} Satisfied mainly by its gates being topologically ordered, and in single static assignment (SSA) form.
        \item \textbf{Instance Well-formedness} and \textbf{Witness Well-formedness:} In isolation, the validity of these resources is indicated by each value being a member of the field.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Evaluation Validity:} Considers all three resources together by evaluating each directive of the relation, consuming each value from the instance and witness streams, and checking that each \texttt{\$assert\_zero} directive carries the value $0$. If this is the case, then statement has a valid set of witness values that evaluate the circuit. In other words, when passed through a ZK backend system, the proof generated would be verified.
\end{enumerate}

Resource and Evaluation Validities may be collectively referred to as \textit{semantics}.

\subsection{IR Tooling (Informational only)}
We will briefly describe a few software suites for working with the SIEVE IR.
They are overviewed for informational purposes only, and their inclusion is not to be construed as an endorsement of either.

\textit{WizToolKit} is a toolkit and a library designed for working with the SIEVE IR in C++.
It includes parsing APIs for both the text and binary formats along with tools for checking \textit{resource validity} and \textit{evaluation validity} (\texttt{wtk-firealarm}), converting between the text and binary formats (\texttt{wtk-press}), and visualizing relations in graph form (\texttt{wtk-viz}).
\textit{WizToolKit} can be found in the \href{https://github.com/stealthsoftwareinc/wiztoolkit}{WizToolKit Repository}.\\

\textit{zkInterface-SIEVE} is an implementation of the FlatBuffers-based SIEVE IR and a set of tools used to enable interoperability between teams. The library extends the open-source \href{https://github.com/QED-it/zkinterface} library, which integrates several R1CS frontends and backends.
It includes API for producing and consuming relations in the IR binary format, and allows for parsing and printing JSON and YAML textual formats. The library includes a \texttt{validator} tool for checking \textit{resource validity}, an \texttt{evaluator} tool for checking \textit{evalutation validity}, a \texttt{metrics} tool for checking different stats about the circuit,  as well as converting to and from the existing \textit{zkInterface} R1CS relations.
\textit{zkInterface-SIEVE} can be found in the \href{https://github.com/QED-it/zkinterface-ir}{zkInterface-sieve repository}.\\

\section{Example}\label{example}
A few samples of the SIEVE IR are given in this section.

\subsection{Point on Curve}\label{ex_ir0}
The following table shows an example arithmetic circuit.
The relation, instance, and witness are shown in their own columns.
The header resource is shown as an element of each of the other resources. \\

\subsection{Fibonacci}\label{ex_ir1}
These excerpts of IR code calculate the first ten (10) Fibonacci numbers.
Notably, the number of repetitions is \textit{not} private, it is a constant of the circuit.
Two versions are presented, one using an anonymous function as the body of the for-loop, another using a named function.\\

\subsubsection*{Anonymous For-Loop Body}
\lstset{language=ir}
\begin{lstlisting}
version 1.0.0;
field characteristic 97 degree 1;
relation
gate_set: arithmetic;
features: @for;
@begin
$0 <- <1>;
$1 <- <1>;
$2...$10 <- @for i @first 2 @last 10
  $i <- @anon_call($(i - 1), $(i - 2),
      @instance: 0, @short_witness: 0)
    $0 <- @add($1, $2);
  @end
@end
@end
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection*{Named For-Loop Body}
\lstset{language=ir}
\begin{lstlisting}
version 1.0.0;
field characteristic 97 degree 1;
relation
gate_set: arithmetic;
features: @function, @for;
@begin
@function(add_2, @out: 1, @in: 2,
    @instance: 0, @short_witness: 0)
  $0 <- @add($1, $2);
@end
$0 <- <1>;
$1 <- <1>;
$2...$10 <- @for i @first 2 @last 10
  $i <- @call(add_2, $(i - 1), $(i - 2));
@end
@end
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Matrix Multiplication}
This example demonstrates the multiplication of two matrices.
It reads matrix $M$ from the instance and matrix $N$ from the witness.
It also reads $C$ from the instance.
Then it computes $C'$ as $M*N$ and asserts that $C=C'$.\\
