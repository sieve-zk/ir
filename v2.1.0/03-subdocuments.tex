\section{Subdocuments of the SIEVE IR}
This spec is organized into multiple subdocuments.

\begin{itemize}
  \item The Circuit-IR document includes formats and semantics for the public and private input streams and the CCC.
  \item The Translation IR document is currently in development, and unreleased.
  \item the Plugins directory contains sub documents for each plugin which has been standardized (although backends are free to develop their own plugins).
\end{itemize}
