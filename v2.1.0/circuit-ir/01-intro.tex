\section{Introduction}
The Circuit-IR has been a workhorse of the SIEVE Program, having been tested during the Phase II testing event.
The SIEVE Circuit-IR encodes a circuit as a sequence of gates, each emitting one or more wires.
This document specifies the format and semantics of the Circuit-IR, the public and private input streams used with it, and the Circuit Configuration Communication (CCC).
For a quick example try jumping ahead to the example in section \ref{sec:circuitir_example}.
